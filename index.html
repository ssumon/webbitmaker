          Anybody who knows me at all knows that my favorite movie of all time is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/">Back to the Future</a>. I’ve seen it literally hundreds of times and it never ceases to entertain. Beyond its entertainment value lies something more, something that the pedestrian Back to the Future watcher might not pick up on. It’s not the fact that the movie is brilliantly directed, cast (Crispin Glover and Thomas F. Wilson were the only possible choices for George and Biff, respectively) and acted, that the subject matter is, on the surface, one of those ethereal ideas that every man, woman and child muses about at some point in their life, or that in Marty McFly we find a protagonist who, by being both the average seventeen-year-old and at the same time the coolest kid in Hill Valley, is so infinitely relatable, that truly makes this a great movie. No, there is a subtext to Back to the Future that goes beyond all these things and speaks directly to the audience in the language of their lives. The first fifteen minutes of the movie are so carefully constructed it would be hard to imagine telling the story any other way. In that crucial fifteen minutes we go from title credits, which themselves contain a plethora of information that becomes important in the film, to Marty travelling back to 1955. Each piece of dialog in this sequence is not only relevant to the rest of the movie but to the rest of the trilogy. In this fifteen minute span we are presented with everything we need to know about Marty McFly, the people that impact his life and Hill Valley in general.

        One of the most crucial plot structures of the story is the depiction of the McFly’s as the typical dysfunctional family. Anyone who has seen the movie knows that the entire plot rests on this idea but looking deeper you can find that there’s more than meets the eye. Before Marty travels through time we’re introduced to his parents, George and Lorraine. We first see George in a confrontation with his supervisor and childhood bully Biff Tannen followed by the whole family at dinner in their dimly lit, early-eighties-styled kitchen/dining room. George is distant as he watches The Honeymooners while Lorraine lectures her kids about dating etiquette. During this sequence there’s a moment that reveals the deeper subtext to the movie.

George and Lorraine met when Lorraine’s father hit George with the car. It is quickly established that the meeting of George and Lorraine and their falling in love is a story that is rehashed quite often during family gatherings. A discussion on this topic leads their daughter to question why George was in the middle of the street in the first place, setting up a subtle but masterful cinematic moment. Pouring another glass of vodka, Lorraine asks George if bird-watching was the reason he was in the street that day. George, distracted by the reports he’s writing for Biff but also clearly having heard the question, feigns as though he hadn’t and the conversation moves along with Lorraine sipping on her vodka.

This moment speaks volumes about the true relationship between George and Lorraine as well as the family dynamic. George has been living with a lie of omission about his Peeping Tom activities for thirty years while Lorraine has clearly been coping with the sobering realisation that the Florence Nightingale effect (when nurses fall in love with their patients) had worn off and that she had married the world’s greatest under-acheiver through alcoholism. These sad realisations, expressed in an almost off-hand moment at the beginning of the film imparts a deeper sense of sadness not only to George and Lorraine, but also to Marty and his siblings. Of course, this realisation can only be truly appreciated after watching the entire movie but, once realised, this movie that seems so innocuous and pulpy at first glance gains a deeper, more resonant context.

Marty can’t relate to his mother and can’t respect his father. Back in 1955, Doc asks him what his parents like to do together and Marty replies with one word: nothing. As much as these facts drive the plot, they add insight into Marty’s character, as well as those of his parents. It’s this underlying dysfunction that sits at the emotional core of the film. A lot of people can relate to Marty’s situation, particularly in the mid-eighties when the film was first released.

To say that this kind of dysfunction was typical in the teen movies of the eighties would be a monumental understatement. from Joel’s parents in Risky Business to, well, everyone’s parents in anything related to Cameron Crowe, dysfunctional families were the basis of all eighties teen angst. Only Ferris Bueller’s parents seemed to have escaped the fray with a normal, if not somewhat disconnected relationship with each other and their kids, but Ferris had no angst anyways; he was a superhero (now, Cameron, there’s some angst).

The movie goes on to show that Marty’s meddling with the space-time continuum ultimately improves his parents’ relationship and the lives of every member of his family. This is the ultimate hero fantasy of every teenager; going on an adventure in a cool car that solves all of the problems you ever thought you had.

I know it was mine. It still is.
